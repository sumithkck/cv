            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a full stack web developer & Java Developer who is passionate about coding and being creative. I'm constantly looking to grow, seeking out new ideas, learning new technologies and researching various methods to achieve my goals. Coding is something
                I have fallen in love with, This coupled with a life long work ethic of working hard, never giving up and doing what needs to be done has given me the skills required to complete any task. In addition to programming, I have an overall
                love for computers and technology. If I'm not spending my time coding, most probably you will find me gaming, travelling with my camera, building a pc, researching either the latest tech or whatever random idea comes to mind.

                    and technologies to keep up with others.
